# GatewayRouter

This was a project in networking class with the general concept of taking an adjacency matrix of data (with each entry representing weighted path to neighbour).  

Within the adjacency matrix, an entry of -1 denotes there is no edge between nodes.

The final input line denotes the gateway routers we are trying to find a path to.

There is additional information that was available, but I'm trying to keep it somewhat ambiguous so if the prof reuses this assignment.
